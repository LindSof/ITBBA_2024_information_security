## short summary of Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

This text highlights the need for intelligent computer network defense against APTs (advanced persistent threats)

Traditional approaches that focus on vulnerabilities are considered insufficient. the text highlights the importance of understanding threat intent and patterns. The intrusion kill chain is in the paper shown as a good framework on how to effectively analyse and respond to intrusions by helping prioritize investments and evaluate defenses.

By considering the threat aspect, defenders can turn the continued presence of APTs into a liability. As attackers continue to attack, defenders can learn from the ways the attackers attack and thus defend better. Basically, they can make the persistence of APTs a disadvantage for the attackers, reducing the likelihood of the attackers' success in their ongoing intrusion attempts.
